  <h1>The Software library</h1>
<p>The LedControl library is not the first attempt to write . There is
already a library and a lot of code-examples for the Arduino and the
MAX72XX available, but the focus had always been on controlling Leds
layed out in some sort of rectangular matrix. I use the MAX72XX to drive
7-segment displays, so I wanted a function to display numbers (decimal
and hexa-decimal) and also the limited set of alphanumeric characters
that make (visual) sense on this kind of displays. But the library also
provides a basic set of functions by which either individual or groups
of Leds can be switched on and off.</p>
<h2>Creating a LedControl instance</h2>
<p>All the libraries API-functions are called through a variable of type
<code>LedControl</code> which you have to create inside your projects code.</p>
<p>A typical code for library initialization will look like this :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cm">/* We start by including the library */</span>
<span class="cp">#include &quot;LedControl.h&quot;</span>

<span class="cm">/*</span>
<span class="cm"> * Now we create a new LedControl.</span>
<span class="cm"> * We use pins 12,11 and 10 on the Arduino for the SPI interface</span>
<span class="cm"> * Pin 12 is connected to the DATA IN-pin of the first MAX7221</span>
<span class="cm"> * Pin 11 is connected to the CLK-pin of the first MAX7221</span>
<span class="cm"> * Pin 10 is connected to the LOAD(/CS)-pin of the first MAX7221</span>
<span class="cm"> * There will only be a single MAX7221 attached to the arduino</span>
<span class="cm"> */</span>  
 <span class="n">LedControl</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">lc1</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">LedControl</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The first step is obvious. We have to include the <code>LedControl</code>-library.</p>
<p>Then we create an instance of type <code>LedControl</code> through which we
<em>talk</em> to the MAX72XX devices. The initialization of an <code>LedControl</code>
takes 4 arguments. The first 3 arguments are the pin-numbers on the
Arduino that are connected to the MAX72XX. You are free to choose any of
the digital IO-pins on the arduino, but since some of the pins are also
used for serial communication or have a led attached to them its best to
avoid pin 0,1 and 13. I choose pins 12,11 and 10 in my example. The
library does not check the pin-numbers to be '''valid''' in any way.
Passing in something stupid (pin 123??) will break your app. You don't
have to initialize the pins as outputs or set them to a certain state,
the library will do that for you.</p>
<p>The fourth argument to <code>LedControl(dataPin,clockPin,csPin,numDevices)</code>
is the number of cascaded MAX72XX devices you're using with this
<code>LedControl</code>. The library can address up to 8 devices from a single
<code>LedControl</code>-variable. There is a little performance penalty implied
with each device you add to the chain, but amount of memory used by the
library-code will stay the same, no matter how many devices you set.
Since one <code>LedControl</code> cannot address more than 8 devices, only values
between 1..8 are allowed here.</p>
<p>Here is the prototype for a new <code>LedControl</code>-instance:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cm">/*</span>
<span class="cm"> * Create a new controler</span>
<span class="cm"> * Params :</span>
<span class="cm"> * int dataPin The pin on the Arduino where data gets shifted out</span>
<span class="cm"> * int clockPin The pin for the clock</span>
<span class="cm"> * int csPin The pin for selecting the device when data is to be sent</span>
<span class="cm"> * int numDevices The maximum number of devices that can be controled</span>
<span class="cm"> */</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w"> </span>LedControl<span class="o">(</span>int<span class="w"> </span>dataPin<span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span>int<span class="w"> </span>clkPin<span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span>int<span class="w"> </span>csPin<span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span>int<span class="w"> </span>numDevices<span class="o">)</span><span class="err">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you need to control more than 8 MAX72XX, you can always create
another <code>LedControl</code>-variable that uses 3 different pins on your
arduino-board. The only thing you have to do is to initialize another
<code>LedControl</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cm">/* we have to include the library */</span>
<span class="cp">#include &quot;LedControl.h&quot;</span>

<span class="c1">// Create a LedControl for 8 devices...  LedControl</span>

<span class="c1">// ... and another one. Now we control 1024 Leds&#39;s from an arduino, not bad!</span>
<span class="c1">// Note : the second one must use different pins!  LedControl</span>
<span class="n">lc2</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">LedControl</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>There is no way to read the pin-numbers from your code, but there is a
function that requests the maximum number of devices attached to an
<code>LedControl</code>. This can be very handy when you want to loop over the full
list of MAX72XX devices attached. Here is a piece of code that switches
all of the MAX72XX-devices from power saving mode into normal operation.
I'll think you'll get the idea even though we haven't talked about the
<code>shutdown(addr)</code> function yet...</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">#include &quot;LedControl.h&quot;</span>

<span class="c1">// Create a new LedControl for 5 devices...  LedControl</span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">setup</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We iterate over the list of devices by an index that runs from 0 to
<code>getDeviceCount()-1</code>. That would be 0 to 4 in this piece of code. The
index is the ''address'' of each device. This ''address'' will be the
first argument of '''every''' function that sets a feature or a new
(Led-)value on a device. Keep in mind that <code>getDeviceCount()</code> returns
the number of devices attached, but the address of an device starts at 0
for the first one, 1 for the second one,.. <code>getDeviceCount()-1</code> for the
last one. Here is the prototype of the function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">/*</span>
<span class="c"> * Gets the maximum number of devices attached to this LedControl.</span>
<span class="c"> * Returns :</span>
<span class="c"> * int the number of devices attached to this LedControl</span>
<span class="c"> */</span>
<span class="nt">int</span> <span class="nt">LedControl</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="nd">:getDeviceCount</span><span class="o">();</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>Power saving mode</h2>
<p>Leds consume quite a lot of energy when they are lit. For battery
operated devices you'll definitly want to save power by switching the
whole display off, when the user does not need it. A special command
sequence can put the MAX72XX into shutdown mode.</p>
<p>The device will switch off all the Led's on the display, but the data is
retained. You can even continue to send new data during shutdown mode.
When the device is activated later on, the new data will appear on your
display. Here is an example for an <em>invisible</em> countdown on a 7-segment
display:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>//create a new device LedControl lc=LedControl(12,11,10,1);

void countDown() {
    int i=9;
    lc.setDigit(0,(byte)i,false);
    //now we see the number &#39;9&#39;
    delay(1000);
    //switch the display off ...
    lc.shutdown(0,true);
    //and count down silently
    while(i&gt;1) {
      //data is updated, but not shown
      lc.setDigit(0,(byte)i,false);
      i--;
      delay(1000);
    }
    //when we switch the display on again we have already reached &#39;1&#39;
    lc.shutdown(0,false);
    lc.setDigit(0,(byte)i,false);
}
</pre></div>


<p>Here is the prototype for method <code>LedControl.shutdown(addr)</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cm">/*</span>
<span class="cm"> * Set the shutdown (power saving) mode for the device</span>
<span class="cm"> * Params :</span>
<span class="cm"> * int addr The address of the display to control</span>
<span class="cm"> * boolean b If true the device goes into power-down mode. If false</span>
<span class="cm"> *            device goes into normal operation</span>
<span class="cm"> */</span><span class="w"></span>
void<span class="w"> </span>shutdown<span class="o">(</span>int<span class="w"> </span>addr<span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span>bool<span class="w"> </span>b<span class="o">)</span><span class="err">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Please note that the <code>MAX72XX</code> is <strong>always</strong> in shutdown mode when the
Arduino is powered up.</p>
<h3>Limiting the number of digits (ScanLimit)</h3>
<p><em>(This is a kind of experts feature not really needed by most users of
the library. Since the library initializes the</em> <code>MAX72XX</code> <em>to safe
default values, you don't have to read this section just to make your
hardware work)</em></p>
<p>When a new LedControl is created it will activate all 8 digits on all
devices. Each <em>lit</em> digit will be switched on for 1/8 of a second by the
multiplexer circuit that drives the digits. If you have any reason to
limit the number of scanned digits, this is what happens : The Led's get
switched on more frequently, and therefore will be on for longer periods
of time. Setting the scan limit to 4 would mean that a lit Led is now
switched on for 1/4 of a second, so the <code>MAX72XX</code> has to provide the
current on the segment-driver for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>You should read the relevant section of the <code>MAX72XX</code> datasheet
carefully! Its actually possible to <strong>destroy</strong> a <code>MAX72XX</code> by choosing
a bad combination of resistor <code>RSet</code> that limits the current going
through the Led's and the number of digits scanned by the device. The
only reason to tweak the scanlimit at all, is that the display looks too
dark. But this is most likely due to the fact that you haven't raised
the intensity (see Setting display brightness\&lt;SetupBrightness>) on
startup. Anyway, here's the prototype of <code>setScanLimit()</code> for those who
need it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cm">/*</span>
<span class="cm"> * Set the number of digits (or rows) to be displayed.</span>
<span class="cm"> * See datasheet for sideeffects of the scanlimit on the brightness</span>

<span class="cm"> * Params :</span>
<span class="cm"> * int addr The address of the display to control</span>
<span class="cm"> * int limit The number of digits to be displayed</span>
<span class="cm"> * Only values between 0 (only 1 digit) and 7 (all digits) are valid.  </span>
<span class="cm"> */</span><span class="w"></span>
void<span class="w"> </span>setScanLimit<span class="o">(</span>int<span class="w"> </span>addr<span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span>int<span class="w"> </span>limit<span class="o">)</span><span class="err">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<h4>Setting display brightness</h4>
<p>There are three factors that determine the brightness of your display.</p>
<ul>
<li>the value of resistor [[Main.MAX72XXHardware#SelectRSet | <code>RSet</code>]]
    which limits the maximum current going through the Led's.</li>
<li>the [[#SetupScanLimit | scan limit]] of the display. ''(If you read
    the section, you already know that I'd recommend to leave this
    option its safe default.)''</li>
<li>and a comand that allows the brightness of the Leds to be controlled
    from software.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>setIntensity(int addr, int intensity)</code> method lets you control
brightness in 16 discrete steps. Larger values make the display brighter
up to the maximum of 15. Values greater than 15 will be discarded
without changing the intensity of the Leds. You might be surprised to
find out that an intensity of zero will not switch the display
completely off, but we already know how to do this with the
[[#SetupPower | <code>shutdown()</code>]]-function.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cm">/*</span>
<span class="cm"> * Set the brightness of the display.</span>
<span class="cm"> * Params:</span>
<span class="cm"> * int addr the address of the display to control</span>
<span class="cm"> * int intensity the brightness of the display.</span>
<span class="cm"> *               Only values between 0(darkest) and 15(brightest) are valid.</span>
<span class="cm"> */</span><span class="w"></span>
void<span class="w"> </span>setIntensity<span class="o">(</span>int<span class="w"> </span>addr<span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span>int<span class="w"> </span>intensity<span class="o">)</span><span class="err">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Device initialization</h3>
<p>When a new <code>LedControl</code> is created the library will initialize the
hardware with ...</p>
<ul>
<li>the display blanked</li>
<li>the intensity set to the minimum</li>
<li>the device to be in power saving mode</li>
<li>the maximum number of digits on the device activated</li>
</ul>
<p>A blanked display is probably what everybody wants on startup. But with
the intensity at a minimum and the device in shutdown-mode no Leds will
light up in the startup configuration. Most users will do their own
initialization inside the <code>setup()</code>-function. Here is a piece of code
that can be used as a template for creating an <code>LedControl</code> that is
ready to light up Leds at a medium brightness as soon as display data
arrives.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">//we have to include the libary</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Clearing the display</h3>
<p>Before we start to light up Leds there is one more thing:
<code>LedControl.clearDisplay(addr)</code>! It should be obvious what the functions
does...</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cm">/*</span>
<span class="cm"> * Switch all Leds on the display off.</span>
<span class="cm"> * Params:</span>
<span class="cm"> * int addr The address of the display to control</span>
<span class="cm"> */</span><span class="w"></span>
void<span class="w"> </span>clearDisplay<span class="o">(</span>int<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span>addr<span class="o">)</span><span class="err">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>All Led's off after this one, that's it...</p>
<h2>Controlling a Led matrix</h2>
<p><img alt="image" src="../images/ArduinoOnMatrix.jpg" />
Ok, I made this one up, but with 8 <code>MAX72XX</code> you could create a
textdisplay for 12 characters. The picture of my test-setup at the top
of the article reveals that I have only single 5x7 matrix. But this
cheap display is fine for testing the basic concepts of the <code>LedControl</code>
library.</p>
<p>There are 3 different ways to switch a Led in a Matrix on or off. We
start with a function that controls each one of the Led's
individually...</p>
<h3>Control a single Led</h3>
<p>Here is the prototype for the function that switches Leds on or off.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cm">/*</span>
<span class="cm"> * Set the status of a single Led.</span>
<span class="cm"> * Params :</span>
<span class="cm"> * addr address of the display</span>
<span class="cm"> * row the row of the Led (0..7)</span>
<span class="cm"> * col the column of the Led (0..7)</span>
<span class="cm"> * state If true the led is switched on,</span>
<span class="cm"> *       if false it is switched off</span>
<span class="cm"> */</span><span class="w"></span>
void<span class="w"> </span>setLed<span class="o">(</span>int<span class="w"> </span>addr<span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span>int<span class="w"> </span>row<span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span>int<span class="w"> </span>col<span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span>boolean<span class="w"> </span>state<span class="o">)</span><span class="err">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>addr</code> and the <code>state</code> arguments should be clear, but what excatly
is a <code>row</code> and what is a <code>column</code> on the matrix? It really depends on
the wiring bewteen the <code>MAX72XX</code> and your matrix. The
<code>LedControl</code>-library assumes the setup used in this schematic:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../images/LedMatrix.jpg" /></p>
<p>There are 8 rows (indexed from 0..7) and 8 columns (also indexed from
0..7) in the matrix. If we want to light up the Led which is located at
the very right of the 3'rd row from the top, simply take the index of
the Led (2.7) and use is as the row and column arguments.</p>
<p>Here's some code that lights up a few Leds</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>//switch on the led in the 3&#39;rd row 8&#39;th column
//and remember that indices start at 0!  
lc.setLed(0,2,7,true);
//Led at row 0 second from left too
lc.setLed(0,0,1,true);
delay(500);
//switch the first Led off (second one stays on)
lc.setLed(0,2,7,false);
</pre></div>


<p><code>setLed()</code> is fine if you light up only a few Leds, but if more Leds
need to be updated, it would require many lines of code. So there are
two more functions in the library, that control a complete row and
column with a single call.</p>
<h3>Control a row</h3>
<p>The <code>setRow(addr,row,value)</code>-function takes 3 arguments. The first one
is the already familiar address of our device. The second one is the row
that is going to be updated and the third one the value for this row.</p>
<p>But how do we know which Leds light up for a specific value? The value,
a byte, uses a simple encoding where each bit set to 1 represents a lit
led and an unset bit a Led switched off. Here is an example:</p>
<p>We want to light up the marked Leds from the schematic...</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../images/LedMatrixSetRow.jpg" /></p>
<p>The index for the row to be updated is 2. Now we have to set the
byte-value for the Leds to be lit. The easiest approach is to include
the standard header-file <code>&lt;binary.h&gt;</code> to your sketch. Now you can write
down the value in binary encoding and have an exact mapping between bits
set to 1 and the Leds to be switched on. To light up the the Leds from
the example we could simply write:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">//include this file so we can write down a byte in binary encoding</span>
<span class="cp">#include &lt;binary.h&gt;</span>

<span class="c1">//now setting the leds from the third row on the first device is easy</span>
<span class="n">lc</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">setRow</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">B10110000</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If for any reason you can not specify the value in binary encoding, here
is a simple table that maps the decimal values of each bit to the Led it
affects. The two rows at bottom give an example for how to calculate the
decimal value for the example from above.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>          Led 2.0   Led 2.1   Led 2.2   Led 2.3   Led 2.4   Led 2.5   Led 2.6   Led 2.7

<p>=176 (128+32+16)</p>
<p>Inside your code you would use <code>lc.setRow(0,2,176)</code> to update this row
on the first <code>MAX72XX</code> attached to the Arduino. As a side-effect the
<code>setRow()</code>-call is much faster than calling <code>setLed()</code> in turn for each
Led. So use this method whereever you can.</p>
<p>Here is the signature of the method :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cm">/*</span>
<span class="cm"> * Set all 8 Led&#39;s in a row to a new state</span>
<span class="cm"> * Params:</span>
<span class="cm"> * addr address of the display</span>
<span class="cm"> * row row which is to be set (0..7)</span>
<span class="cm"> * value each bit set to 1 will light up the corresponding Led.  </span>
<span class="cm"> */</span><span class="w"></span>
void<span class="w"> </span>setRow<span class="o">(</span>int<span class="w"> </span>addr<span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span>int<span class="w"> </span>row<span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span>byte<span class="w"> </span>value<span class="o">)</span><span class="err">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Control a column</h3>
<p>What can be done for ''rows'' can likewise be done with ''columns''. The
<code>setColumn()</code>-method updates 8 Leds in the vertical columns.</p>
<p>Here is an example.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../images/LedMatrixSetCol.jpg" /></p>
<p>This time we want the 4 leds at the bottom of column 6 to be lit. We can
use the the binary encoding again. Here the leftmost bit in the value
refers to the Led at the top of the column:</p>
<p>and here is the table that maps bits to the Leds for columns:</p>
<p>=15 (8+4+2+1)</p>
<p>The signature of the method is almost the same a the row-version of it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cm">/*</span>
<span class="cm"> * Set all 8 Led&#39;s in a column to a new state</span>
<span class="cm"> * Params:</span>
<span class="cm"> * addr address of the display</span>
<span class="cm"> * col column which is to be set (0..7)</span>
<span class="cm"> * value each bit set to 1 will light up the corresponding Led.</span>
<span class="cm"> */</span><span class="w"> </span>void<span class="w"> </span>setColumn<span class="o">(</span>int<span class="w"> </span>addr<span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span>int<span class="w"> </span>col<span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span>byte<span class="w"> </span>value<span class="o">)</span><span class="err">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>A complete example for the Led matrix functions can be found on the
<a href="http://example.com">demo-page</a> for the library.</p>
<h2>Control 7-Segment displays</h2>
<p>It's not the standard usage for 7-segment Leds...</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../images/ArduinoOn7Segment.jpg" /></p>
<p>but looks good!</p>
<h3>Print numbers</h3>
<p>The most common use of 7-segment displays is to show numbers. The first
function we look at, takes an argument of type byte and prints the
corresponding digit on the specified column. The range of valid values
runs from 0..15. All values between 0..9 are printed as digits, values
between 10..15 are printed as their hexadecimal equivalent.</p>
<p>Any other value will simply be ignored, which means '''nothing''' will
be printed. The column on nthe display will not be blanked, it will
simply retain its last valid value. The decimal point on the column can
be switched on or off with an extra argument.</p>
<p>Here is a small example that prints an int value (-999..999) on a
display with 4 digits.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>void printNumber(int v) {  
    int ones;  
    int tens;  
    int hundreds;
    boolean negative;

if(v &lt; -999 || v &gt; 999)  
        return;  
    if(v&lt;0) {  
        negative=true;
        v=v*-1;  
    }
    ones=v%10;  
    v=v/10;  
    tens=v%10;  
    v=v/10;
    hundreds=v;  
    if(negative) {  
        //print character &#39;-&#39; in the leftmost column  
        lc.setChar(0,3,&#39;-&#39;,false);  
    } else {
        //print a blank in the sign column  
        lc.setChar(0,3,&#39; &#39;,false);  
    }  
    //Now print the number digit by digit
    lc.setDigit(0,2,(byte)hundreds,false);
    lc.setDigit(0,1,(byte)tens,false);
    lc.setDigit(0,0,(byte)ones,false); }
</pre></div>


<p>This is the prototype for the function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cm">/*</span>
<span class="cm"> * Display a (hexadecimal) digit on a 7-Segment Display</span>
<span class="cm"> * Params:</span>
<span class="cm"> * addr address of the display</span>
<span class="cm"> * digit the position of the digit on the display (0..7)</span>
<span class="cm"> * value the value to be displayed. (0x00..0x0F)</span>
<span class="cm"> * dp sets the decimal point.  </span>
<span class="cm"> */</span><span class="w">  </span>
void<span class="w"> </span>setDigit<span class="o">(</span>int<span class="w"> </span>addr<span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span>int<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span>digit<span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span>byte<span class="w"> </span>value<span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span>boolean<span class="w"> </span>dp<span class="o">)</span><span class="err">;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>digit</code>-argument must be from the range 0..7 because the MAX72XX can
drive up to eight 7-segment displays. The index starts at 0 as usual.</p>
<h3>Print characters</h3>
<p>There is a limited set of characters that make (visual) sense on a
7-segment display. A common use would be the character '-' for negative
values and the 6 characters from 'A'..'F' for hex-values.</p>
<p>The <code>setChar(addr,digit,value.dp)</code>-function accepts a value of type char
for the whole range of 7-bit ASCII encoding. Since the recognizable
patterns are limited, most of the defined characters will be the
<code>&lt;SPACE&gt;</code>-char. But there are quite a few characters that make sense on
a 7-segment display.</p>
<p>Here is the set of printable characters:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</code></li>
<li><code>A a</code> (prints upper case)</li>
<li><code>B b</code> (prints lower case)</li>
<li><code>C c</code> (prints lower case)</li>
<li><code>D d</code> (prints lower case)</li>
<li><code>E e</code> (prints upper case)</li>
<li><code>F f</code> (prints upper case)</li>
<li><code>H h</code> (prints upper case)</li>
<li><code>L l</code> (prints upper case)</li>
<li><code>P p</code> (prints upper case)</li>
<li><code>-</code> (the minus sign)</li>
<li><code>.,</code> (lights up the decimal-point)</li>
<li><code>_</code> (the underscore)</li>
<li><code>&lt;SPACE&gt;</code> (the blank or space char)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For your conveniance, the hexadecimal characters have also been
redefined at the character values 0x00...0x0F. If you want to mix digits
and characters on the display, you can simply take the same byte
argument that you would have used for the <code>setDigit()</code>-function and it
will print the hexadecimal value.</p>
<p>The prototype of the function is almost the same as the one for
displaying digits.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cm">/*</span>
<span class="cm"> * Display a character on a 7-Segment display.</span>
<span class="cm"> * There are only a few characters that make sense here :</span>
<span class="cm"> * &#39;0&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;3&#39;,&#39;4&#39;,&#39;5&#39;,&#39;6&#39;,&#39;7&#39;,&#39;8&#39;,&#39;9&#39;,&#39;0&#39;,</span>
<span class="cm"> * &#39;A&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;,&#39;d&#39;,&#39;E&#39;,&#39;F&#39;,&#39;H&#39;,&#39;L&#39;,&#39;P&#39;,</span>
<span class="cm"> * &#39;.&#39;,&#39;-&#39;,&#39;_&#39;,&#39; &#39;</span>
<span class="cm"> * Params:</span>
<span class="cm"> * addr address of the display</span>
<span class="cm"> * digit the position of the character on the display (0..7)</span>
<span class="cm"> * value the character to be displayed.</span>
<span class="cm"> * dp sets the decimal point.  </span>

<h2>Commented demos for the library</h2>
<p>Some commented demos for the <code>LedControl</code>-library are on page
[[LedControlDemos]]. You can also download the code for the demos from
[[LedControlDemos | there]].</p>
<h2>Sourcecode and download</h2>
<p>The sourcecode of the library is available as a zip-file :
<a href="http://arduino.cc/playground/uploads/Main/LedControl.zip">LedControl.zip</a></p>
<p>The zip-file will create a new directory named LedControl with 3 files:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>LedControl/LedControl.h</code></dt>
<dd>The header to be included into your project</dd>
<dt><code>LedControl/LedControl.cpp</code></dt>
<dd>The implementation of the functions</dd>
<dt><code>LedControl/keywords.txt</code></dt>
<dd>installs syntax highlighting for the library</dd>
</dl>
<p>You have to unpack the zip-file into the library directory of your
arduino environment. The location of the library directory has changed
with more recent versions of the arduino environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are running a version from <code>0007</code> up to <code>0009</code> the libraries
    are located at <code>arduino-&lt;version&gt;/lib/targets/libraries/</code></li>
<li>Starting with version <code>0010</code> the Arduino IDE expects libraries to be
    installed at <code>arduino-&lt;version&gt;/hardware/libraries/</code></li>
</ul>
<p>When the file
<a href="http://arduino.cc/playground/uploads/Main/LedControl.zip">LedControl.zip</a>
has been unpacke into one of the directory from above, the new library
has to be compiled. From the arduino-ide this is very simple. Create a
new sketch with the following content...</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">#include &quot;LedControl.h&quot;</span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">setup</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">loop</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>... hit the verify button. Now the library will be compiled and is
available for all of your sketches that start with a
<code>#include "LedControl.h"</code> line.</p>
<p>The Zip-File also contains 3 example sketches which are documented on
the demos page.</p>
